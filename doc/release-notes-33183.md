------------

Transaction Script validation errors used to return the reason for the error prefixed by either
"mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed" if it was a consensus error, or "non-mandatory-script-verify-flag"
(without "-failed") if it was a standardness error. This has been changed to "block-script-verify-flag-failed"
and "mempool-script-verify-flag-failed" for all block and mempool errors respectively.
