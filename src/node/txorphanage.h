/** A class to track orphan transactions (failed on TX_MISSING_INPUTS)
 * Since we cannot distinguish orphans from bad transactions with non-existent inputs, we heavily limit the amount of
 * announcements (unique (NodeId, wtxid) pairs), the number of inputs, and size of the orphans stored (both individual
 * and summed). We also try to prevent adversaries from churning this data structure: once global limits are reached, we
 * continuously evict the oldest announcement (sorting non-reconsiderable orphans before reconsiderable ones) from the
 * most resource-intensive peer until we are back within limits.
 * - Peers can exceed their individual limits (e.g. because they are very useful transaction relay peers) as long as the
 *   global limits are not exceeded.
 * - As long as the orphan has 1 announcer, it remains in the orphanage.
 * - No peer can trigger the eviction of another peer's orphans.
 * - Peers' orphans are effectively protected from eviction as long as they don't exceed their limits.
 * Not thread-safe. Requires external synchronization.
